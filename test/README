Need to keep this in order, without too much hassle with the Gruntfile#vows#src
configuration, hence the numbered test modules.


Issues with existing test cases

 - vows will load all modules prior to running the tests from each module
 - isolating each test will not work and results in an error


which basically boils down to

 - subclassof being registered globally
 - monkey patches and assert.subclassOf being applied before any
   other tests have been run
